# QuickSort
Quick Sort is a widely used and efficient sorting algorithm. It's known for its average-case time complexity of O(n log n).
Quick Sort is often implemented using recursion. The main sorting process is recursive in nature, where you partition the array and recursively sort the subarrays on both sides of the pivot.
* Quick Sort is often considered one of the fastest general-purpose sorting algorithms.
* It is efficient for large datasets and has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n).
* Quick Sort is not stable (order of equal elements may change) and may not perform well on mostly sorted data.
